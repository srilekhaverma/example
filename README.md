Flint is designed to be a flexible layout toolkit that developers can use for any responsive grid-based project. Built on Sass 3.3, Flint is capable of complex responsive layouts customized at each breakpoint; all while using a single mixin, having minimal output, as well as being completely semantic. All of your layout settings are housed in a simple config file and is immensely customizable. Flint will only output the code you need, and nothing else. We handle the hard stuff, so you can focus on the rest.  Take it for a spin on SassMeister.com!  Enjoy.
